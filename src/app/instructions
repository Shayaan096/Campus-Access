1️⃣ Registration Page

Purpose: Collect student info to “activate” the app for this student.

Flow / Behavior:

Show a simple form with fields:

Name

Father’s Name

Email

Department

User enters info → taps “Register”

App saves this info locally (service or localStorage)

After successful registration → navigate to Home / QR page

Notes:

Only one-time registration per device

Simple validation: all fields filled

No backend yet

2️⃣ Home / QR Page

Purpose: Generate QR code for campus entry.

Flow / Behavior:

Display student info (name, email, department) to confirm identity

Show a “Generate QR” button

On click → generate QR code containing:

Student info (from local storage)

Timestamp or current datetime

Display QR code on screen

Notes:

QR represents “entry request”

This QR can later be scanned by the gate camera / edge device

Optional: show timestamp or expiry info under QR

3️⃣ QR Expiry (Optional Enhancement)

Purpose: Make QR code time-limited for security.

Flow / Behavior:

QR only valid for X minutes (e.g., 2 minutes)

Show countdown timer under QR

After expiry → QR disappears or button says “Regenerate QR”

Notes:

Helps prevent screenshot abuse

Still uses local storage only

4️⃣ (Optional) Result / Feedback Page

Purpose: Show access result after QR scanned (simulate it for demo).

Flow / Behavior:

If scanned → show:

✅ Access Granted

❌ Access Denied

🚨 Security Alert (if simulating weapon/facial mismatch)

For now, can simulate by tapping a button

Notes:

This is purely UI feedback for the student

No real scanning yet

App Navigation

Registration Page → Home/QR Page after first registration

Optional: add simple navigation back to Home if QR expires

Keep the flow linear and clean — no extra pages

Extra Notes

Keep UI minimal, don’t overdesign

Student data is saved locally, no Firebase / backend yet

QR is generated from local student info + timestamp

Edge device / scanning logic is outside this app

basically:
Registration → Home → Generate QR → (optional: expiry / feedback)
